# Test driven development for algorithms and data structures 

Technologies : The algorithms and data structures are implemented in python, the testing framework I am using is pytest 
https://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/

Data structures covered : 
1) Linked Lists: List nodes, Node insertions, Node searches, reverse linked lists
LRU Caches


+ **Continuous Integration** - [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/priyankaparikh/algorithms.svg?branch=linked-lists)](https://travis-ci.com/priyankaparikh/algorithms.svg?branch=linked-lists) - "*build passing*" indicates that the project's **tests** all **pass** as expected. If you see that the build for a project is "*broken*" it means the software does *not* work as advertised! This is a clear sign that you should not be using it (*until it gets fixed!*) ... check the repo's issues to see if it's a known problem, if not, *report it*!  
We use [***Travis CI***](https://travis-ci.org/) for our CI.
